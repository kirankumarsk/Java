/*You have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of someones total age.
When someone blows out the candles, theyâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
For example, if your someone is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height
4,4,1,3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, 
since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.*/
